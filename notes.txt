in routerLink, if "servers" or "./servers" or "../servers" is given. Then it's relative path ! PATH == It appends the path u give to the current path

in routerLink, if "/servers" is given. Then it's absolute path ! PATH == It removes the current path & overwrites the path entirely given in braces



RouterLinkActive directive analyzes ur current loaded path which links lead to the route which leads to the path 
and by default it marks a element as active if it adds the css class if it contains the path u are on or if this link 
is part of the path which is currently loaded.

routerLink="/" is for all paths. So to configure this, RouterLinkActiveOptions  directive is used.
